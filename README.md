* The module can be enabled and run on any standard Drupal 8 installation without requiring additional modules.
* Create a form implemented using Drupalâ€™s Form API containing at least the following elements.
  * Text input field for a number.
  * A second text input field for a number.
  * A submit button
  * When the form is submitted, it should return the sum of the 2 numbers in a standard Drupal message or elsewhere on the page.
  * Have a normal menu item that can live in the standard navigation or main menu that links to the form.
* Extra credit:
  * Validate the form input to ensure the values are numeric.
  * Use AJAX to show the calculated value when the user is completing the form (in addition to the message on submission).
  * Write an automated test to ensure the numbers are added correctly.
